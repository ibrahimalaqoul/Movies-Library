## Getting Started
For the first step i called the express framework , and i did declared the express as a func. in a constant called myapp. then i did the command listen to make sure it's alive.For the endpoints i did use get command wich take two params the first is the path and the second is the function i will call to send the data .
for today it was different like we have to get data from API , it was super easy as long as i understand how i deal with data from the API.
leant how to decument any Online API.
